							DeHub-related transactions. DeHub is not responsible for determining the
							taxes that apply to your transactions on the Binance Smart Chain Network or

							Network. Any transfer of DeHub Tokens occurs within the blockchain in the
							Binance Smart Chain Network, and not on the Service. <br><br>
							There are risks associated with using an Internet-based currency, including, but

							of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain
							unauthorized access to information stored within Your wallet. You accept and

							operation could negatively impact potential utility or value of DeHub Tokens.
							The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies,
							and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially
							adversely affect the development of DeHub’s operation, and therefore the
							potential utility or value of DeHub Tokens.

							resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or
							formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to any claim
							that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The
							arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of You and DeHub. The
							arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined
							with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant
							motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the
							authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy
							or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s
							rules, and the Terms (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall
							issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential
							findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation
							of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief
							on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of
							the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. <br><br>
							Waiver of Jury Trial. <br><br>
							You and DeHub waiver rights to stand before any jury in any form of trial for and
							instead instead elect that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by
							arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in
							writing above. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages
							and relief as a court and must follow these Terms as a court would. However,
							there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award
							is subject to very limited review. All claims made via arbitration are done so on a
							sole, case by case service and can in no way be combined with or aggregated
							to any other case. If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes
							enforcement of any part of this subsection’s limitations as to a given claim for
							relief, then that claim must be severed from the arbitration and brought in the
							Philippine Arbitration Services. All other claims shall be arbitrated. <br>
							Severability. Except as provided in this Section, if any part or parts of this
							Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable,
							then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be
							severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full
							force and effect. <br>
							Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination
							of your relationship with DeHub.
