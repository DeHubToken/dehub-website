							DeHub, the team or this website under no circumstance provide financial
							guidance or advice of any nature. Always do your research prior to purchasing
							any digital assets or commodities. Any form of DeHub token sales are for the
							purpose of generating liquidity to enable traders to buy and sell tokens. All
							presales and private sales were open to members of our communities and our
							public sale will be barrier-less. All pre-mined tokens are technically already
							“burnt” and the ecosystem is designed to be self sufficient and empowering to
							its users therefor not relying on a central point of control or business operation.
							DeHub tokens hold no monetary value nor do they serve as any form of
							investment vehicle. You are not here to fly to the moon you are here to change
							the earth. By purchasing DeHub tokens you acquire a piece of a decentralised
							network that will forever operate on multiple blockchains that serve as utility
							and governance tokens. These allow you to vote on; renewals, cancellations
							and funding of original productions and licensed motion picture, sports results
							including MMA and Boxing, review and awards creators and artists, access and
							wager on games, bets and so much more. There are no guarantees of the value
							of the tokens and the team are and will never be liable for any losses incurred
							by any buying or selling tokens. You must understand what you are doing in the
							new digital world of finance and every step you take is taken at your own risk
							with trust in your own judgment and actions. DeHub tokens are backed by the
							liquidity we, the community provide therefore the price action is solely
							dependant on the supply and demand of the DeHub tokens (elasticity) on any
							given day and any mentions of price speculation by any members of the
							community or team should be deemed as purely commentary on day to day
							financial affairs. DeHub tokens will be very elastic in price given the nature of
							our economy so if these terms confuse you or you are unsure of whether you
							understand what you are reading, we advise you take your time to re-read the
							website fully and contact a member of the team for assistance. Although
							DeHub is operating as a decentralised autonomous organisation with no official
							headquarters or central office, our community leaders are registering in every
							single country we start to expand in laying down official ground teams via a
							decentralised network of token holders ensuring maximum transparency for
							stakeholders and motivation for workers. South East Asia, Africa and the Middle
							East are our main areas of operation however we aim to have a DeHub in every
							major city across the world by 2042. DeHub will never ask for your keys or hold
							your funds. Not your keys not your crypto. Never forget. Citizens of the USA or
							any other country or jurisdiction without clear regulation regarding token sales
							are advised to contact their local government or council offices for advise.
